# word-search
This project aims to make a word search solver that solves from a photo of the word search. Using Google's text recognition apis,
the text in the word search can be passed into a Python function that prints a matrix that shows where all of the words are
found.

At the moment, the solver works for a 14x14 puzzle. It has not been tested for any other sizes. Problems may come up in puzzles
that are not square, and if they do they will need to be fixed.
